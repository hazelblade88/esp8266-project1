# esp8266-project1
Smart IoT Garbage Bin
 Built a Smart IoT Garbage Bin from E-Waste! 

Excited to share my latest college project — a Smart Garbage Monitoring System built using ESP8266 and mostly recycled materials.

🔧 What it does:
• 📏 Ultrasonic sensor measures bin fill level
• 📺 OLED displays real-time garbage percentage
• 📱 Blynk IoT app enables remote monitoring
• 🌐 Local web server for on-site checking
• 🔥 DHT11 monitors temperature for fire safety
• 🔔 Automatic alerts when bin is full or overheating
• 📊 Daily morning report for garbage truck planning
• 📡 ESP8266 hotspot for offline access

💡 Why this matters:
This system helps prevent overflow, improves waste collection efficiency, and adds an extra safety layer against fire hazards — all built from low-cost and reused components.

🛠️ Tech Used:
ESP8266 (NodeMCU) | Ultrasonic Sensor | DHT11 | OLED | Blynk IoT | Embedded C | IoT

Proud to combine IoT + sustainability + smart city concept in a simple prototype.
